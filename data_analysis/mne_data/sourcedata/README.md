# Source Data

The data contained in this folder is minimally processed in the sense that it was converted from original .cnt format to .fif, which can be loaded in MNE-Python toolbox. I chose .fif format because it did not require any special input and thus was easy to save (I tried to manipulate the file as little as possible while working with python2, which was required in order to run the [read_antcnt.py](https://github.com/mtiessen1175/hyperscanning-2.0/tree/master/load_CNT/) script by behinger).
